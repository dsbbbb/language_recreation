Borges has read everything, and especially what nobody reads any more: the Cabalists, the Alexandrine Greeks, medieval philosophers. His erudition is not profound -- he asks of it only flashes of lightning and ideas -- but it is vast. For example, Pascal wrote: ""Nature is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere."" Borges sets out to hunt down this metaphor through the centuries. He finds in Giordano Bruno (1584): ""We can assert with certainty that the universe is all center, or that the center of the universe is everywhere and its circumference nowhere."" But Giordano Bruno had been able to read in a twelfth-century French theologian, Alain de Lille, a formulation borrowed from the Corpus Hermeticum (third century): ""God is an intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere."" Such researches, carried out among the Chinese as among the Arabs or the Egyptians, delight Borges, and lead him to the subjects of his stories.

Borges has read everything, and especially what nobody reads any more: the Cabalists, the Alexandrine Greeks, medieval philosophers. His erudition is not profound -- he asks of it only flashes of lightning and ideas -- but it is vast. For example, Pascal wrote: ""Nature is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere."" Borges sets out to hunt down this metaphor through the centuries. He finds in Giordano Bruno (1584): ""We can assert with certainty that the universe is all center, or that the center of the universe is everywhere and its circumference nowhere."" But Giordano Bruno had been able to read in a twelfth-century French theologian, Alain de Lille, a formulation borrowed from the Corpus Hermeticum (third century): ""God is an intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere."" Such researches, carried out among the Chinese as among the Arabs or the Egyptians, delight Borges, and lead him to the subjects of his stories.","3","","","","Jorge Luis Borges (another important character for us to meet), was described as ((find borges passage from intro about him and chasing things down through time""131","493D3EF7-D2D7-443E-BA7B-984820F72B7D","2016-06-04T14:08:54-0400","2016-06-04T14:08:54-0400","","{314, 323}","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","","","""132","A0BAD5AB-53C7-4DB5-9324-526BEEE2E418","2016-06-04T14:04:59-0400","2016-06-04T14:06:38-0400","Finding the forever truths-or Walter Benjamin’s Angel of History and Sankofa skim the eternal archives ","{-3145.10009765625, 4597.7998046875}","","","","","","","","","","","","Rectangle","","","","","0","Finding the forever truths-or Walter Benjamin’s Angel of History and Sankofa skim the eternal archives ""133","0A9D0D1A-7BD0-4F9B-A382-8051C568914E","2016-06-04T14:07:01-0400","2016-06-04T14:07:09-0400","Subcomandante Marcos","{-775.29998779296875, -180.60000610351562}","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","Subcomandante Marcos""134","C3A29580-AD70-4CCB-B9B4-A8579FBE18CD","2016-06-04T14:07:11-0400","2016-06-04T14:07:25-0400","MLK?
